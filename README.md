# SALES-PREDICTION---OIBSIP
SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
## Objective
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So let's start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

## Solution
We'll use the provided Advertising.csv file, which likely contains data on advertising expenditures across various platforms and the resulting sales. Here's the general plan for our project:
1.	Data Loading and Exploration:

o	Load the data from the CSV file.

o	Explore the data to understand its structure and contents.

2.	Data Preprocessing:

o	Check for missing values and handle them if any.

o	Perform any necessary feature engineering.

3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

o	Visualize the data to understand relationships between variables.

o	Summarize key statistics.

4.	Model Building:

o	Split the data into training and testing sets.

o	Train a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.

5.	Model Evaluation:

o	Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).

6.	Predictions:

o	Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
